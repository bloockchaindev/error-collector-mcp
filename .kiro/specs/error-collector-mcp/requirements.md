# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The Error Collector MCP is an open-source Model Context Protocol server that runs locally to collect errors from browser console and terminal, then uses OpenRouter's free models to generate intelligent summaries. This enables AI agents like Kiro to quickly understand and solve errors by providing contextual, summarized error information rather than raw error logs.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer using Kiro, I want the MCP server to automatically collect browser console errors, so that I can get AI-powered error analysis without manually copying error messages.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a browser console error occurs THEN the system SHALL capture the error message, stack trace, and timestamp
2. WHEN multiple errors occur in sequence THEN the system SHALL collect all errors with proper ordering
3. WHEN an error is captured THEN the system SHALL store the error with relevant context (URL, user agent, page title)
4. IF the browser console is not accessible THEN the system SHALL provide clear instructions for enabling error collection

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer using Kiro, I want the MCP server to collect terminal errors and problems, so that I can get comprehensive error analysis across all development environments.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a terminal command fails THEN the system SHALL capture the exit code, error output, and command that was executed
2. WHEN compilation errors occur THEN the system SHALL capture the full error output with file paths and line numbers
3. WHEN the system detects common error patterns THEN the system SHALL categorize the error type (syntax, runtime, network, etc.)
4. IF terminal access is restricted THEN the system SHALL gracefully handle permission issues

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer using Kiro, I want the collected errors to be summarized using OpenRouter's free models, so that I can understand the root cause and potential solutions quickly.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN errors are collected THEN the system SHALL send them to OpenRouter's free model for analysis
2. WHEN the AI model processes errors THEN the system SHALL generate a summary including root cause, impact, and suggested solutions
3. WHEN multiple related errors exist THEN the system SHALL group them and provide a consolidated summary
4. IF the OpenRouter API is unavailable THEN the system SHALL queue errors for later processing
5. WHEN API rate limits are reached THEN the system SHALL implement proper backoff and retry logic

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer using Kiro, I want the MCP server to expose error summaries through standard MCP tools, so that Kiro can easily access and use the error analysis.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN Kiro requests error information THEN the system SHALL provide summaries through MCP tool calls
2. WHEN error summaries are requested THEN the system SHALL return structured data with error details, summaries, and timestamps
3. WHEN filtering is requested THEN the system SHALL support filtering by time range, error type, or source
4. IF no errors are available THEN the system SHALL return an appropriate empty response

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to configure the MCP server settings, so that I can customize error collection behavior and OpenRouter integration.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the server starts THEN the system SHALL load configuration from a local config file
2. WHEN configuration includes OpenRouter API key THEN the system SHALL use it for API calls
3. WHEN error collection preferences are set THEN the system SHALL respect filtering rules (ignore certain error types, domains, etc.)
4. IF configuration is invalid THEN the system SHALL provide clear error messages and use sensible defaults
5. WHEN configuration changes THEN the system SHALL reload settings without requiring a restart

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the MCP server to run locally and be open source, so that I can trust the security and customize it for my needs.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the server is installed THEN the system SHALL run entirely on the local machine
2. WHEN error data is processed THEN the system SHALL never send raw error data to third parties except OpenRouter for summarization
3. WHEN the source code is accessed THEN the system SHALL be available under an open source license
4. IF privacy concerns exist THEN the system SHALL provide options to disable external API calls
5. WHEN contributing to the project THEN the system SHALL have clear documentation for setup and development
